-- Here's a MySQL query that calculates the average daily sales of a supermarket for a given 
period of time:

SELECT date, AVG(amount) AS average_daily_sales
FROM sales
WHERE date >= '2023-08-14'
AND date < '2023-08-21'
GROUP BY date

-- This query selects the date and amount columns from the sales table, where the date is 
-- between '2023-08-14' and '2023-08-20'. The results are then grouped by date, and the average 
-- daily sales are calculated using the AVG() function.

-- Note that this query assumes the sales table has a date and amount column, and the date 
-- is in a compatible format for >= and < operators. Modify the query if your database differs.
