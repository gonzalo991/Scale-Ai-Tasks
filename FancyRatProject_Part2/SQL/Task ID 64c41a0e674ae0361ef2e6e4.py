given the following database and its values, generate a query to obtain the books grouped by genre and author, showing the number of books in each group

To group the books by genre and author, you can use the following SQL query:

SELECT genre, author, COUNT(DISTINCT book) AS num_books
FROM books
GROUP BY genre, author
This query will group the books by genre and author, and count the number of books in each group. The COUNT(DISTINCT book) function will ensure that each book is only counted once, even if it appears in multiple groups.

now generate a query to find books with prices higher than the average price of all books

Here is a SQL query that finds books with prices higher than the average price of all books:

SELECT b.*
FROM books b
JOIN (
    SELECT genre, AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM books
    GROUP BY genre
) AS avg_prices ON b.genre = avg_prices.genre
WHERE b.price > avg_prices.avg_price;
This query will return all books that have a price greater than the average price of all books. The SELECT AVG(price) statement calculates the average price of all books, and the WHERE clause filters the books that have a price greater than the average price.

now i want a query to find the books with prices above the average price in their genre.

Here is a SQL query that finds books with prices above the average price in their genre:

SELECT title, price
FROM (
  SELECT title, price, AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY genre) AS book_average_price
  FROM books
) AS subquery
WHERE price > book_average_price;
This code retrieves the titles and prices of books from the Books table, calculates the average price for each genre using a subquery and a windowing function, and then filters the results to include only books that are priced higher than the average price for each genre.

now i want a query to calculate the range of years of publication for each genre of book.

Here is a SQL query that calculates the range of years of publication for each genre of book:

SELECT genre, MIN(publication_year) AS min_year, MAX(publication_year) AS max_year
FROM books
GROUP BY genre;
This SQL query retrieves the genre of the books, the oldest year of publication and the most recent year of publication for each of the genres. It uses the MIN aggregate function to calculate the minimum year of publication and the MAX aggregate function to calculate the maximum year of publication. The GROUPBY clause groups the results by genres, allowing you to apply the aggregate functions to each group individually.

now i want a query that shows the titles of books with a similar price range in their genre.

Here is a SQL query that shows the titles of books with a similar price range in their genre:

SELECT title, price, genre
FROM (
  SELECT title, price, genre,
         NTILE(3) OVER (PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY price) AS price_range
  FROM books
) AS price_range_subquery
WHERE price_range = 2;
This query will group books by genre and price range and return the titles of each group. The price range is determined by the minimum and maximum prices in each group.
