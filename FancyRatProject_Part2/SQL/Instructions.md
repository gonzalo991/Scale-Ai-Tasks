# Concept to cover (this is what your task must be about):
### Applied SQL using functions.

*Practical implementation and utilization of SQL functions in real-world scenarios. Your goal is to ask a question that requires an answer that uses functions. While you shouldn’t explicitly indicate to the chatbot that this is needed in the response, the solution to your question must be an SQL query incorporating it. . Try to include a variety of window functions. Depending on the chosen SQL flavor, different functions will be available. For example, in MySQL, you can explore various functions here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_mysql.asp*

### Operation for 1st prompt (you only need to follow this for your 1st prompt):

**Rewrite: Ask the assistant to edit or modify an existing piece of code following various instructions.**

**Subsequent Prompt Guidance (how you must continue your conversation past the first response):**

*(Conversation) Follow-up on previous responses: For all subsequent prompts, you must ask follow-ups, refinements, or clarifications specifically on previous responses or prompts. This should feel and sound like a CONVERSATION - follow-up prompts shouldn’t be able to stand on their own in a new conversation and receive the same response.*

----------

#### In this task, you will have conversations with the Bot to improve its coding abilities. 

#### At each turn of the conversation, you will give the model an instruction and receive a response from the model trying to follow that instruction. You will then rewrite the model’s response in accordance with the guidelines. 

#### To ensure diversity of conversations, you will be assigned a Concept, and an Operation to begin the conversation. You will also be assigned a Subsequent Prompt Guidance on how to continue the conversation. 

 

# IMPORTANT UPDATE:

*We are currently working on improving the chatbot's code generation ability. Our goal is to ask questions that prompt the chatbot to respond with generated code, along with an explanation of the generated code. So:*

**Follow the operation given in the instructions for the first prompt.**
*All subsequent prompts should be asking the bot to generate or modify code in some way.*
*You will encounter the same instructions more than once; however, it is important to ask unique and diverse questions for each task. Remember, repeating them is not allowed.*
