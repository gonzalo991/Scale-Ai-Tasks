1. Improve this code adding functionalities for training simulation

Here is an improved version of the code that integrates the training simulation
into the architectural visualisation using the A-frame:

     Training Simulation

    <a-box position="-4 1 -5" width="1" height="1" depth="1" color="#FF0000" static-body></a-box>
  </a-scene>
</body>
</html>
```
To explain:
- This improved code is an extension of the previous architecture visualisation code with
the addition of a training simulation feature.
- To indicate the training mode, a text entity (<a-text>) is added.
- To represent an obstacle in the training simulation, a red box (<a-box>) is placed next to the text entity.
To make it immobile, the static-body component is assigned to it.
- The user will be able to navigate around the scene and interact with the objects as before, but now they will have
to navigate around the obstacle in the training simulation.
- To suit your specific training scenario, you can adjust the position, size and appearance of the training elements.
- With this enhanced code, users can simulate training scenarios that require them to avoid obstacles or follow
specific paths, while still being able to explore and navigate the architectural environment.

2. How is physics simulation integrated into the scene in this code?

The AFrame physics system is used in the supplied code to integrate the physics simulation into the scene.
AFrame provides physics interactions and simulations within the virtual environment using a physics component
called aframe physics system.

The integration of the physics simulation into the code is done in the following steps:

The AFrame physics system is included in the HTML file in the form of a script —
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aframe-physics-system/dist/aframe-physics-system.min.js"></script>
```
The objects that are in need of physics simulation have physics components added to them. This code represents
objects as HTML entities using the a-entity tag. For example, the definition of the ground is —
```html
<a-entity id="ground" static-body geometry="primitive: plane" position="0 -1 0" rotation="-90 0 0" material="color: #7BC8A4"></a-entity>
```
To indicate that the ground is a static object, unaffected by physics, the static body component is added.
3. The scene element is annotated with the Physics attribute, which allows the entire scene to become physically simulated —
```html
<a-scene physics>
  ...
</a-scene>
```
The code integrates physics simulation into architectural visualisation by incorporating the AFrame physics system,
adding physics components to objects, and enabling on scene physics. Based on the physics rules defined by the AFrame
physics system, objects with physics components exhibit realistic interactions such as collisions, gravity and motion.


3. What HTML elements are used to represent the objects in this code?

The following HTML elements are used to represent the objects in the architectural visualisation in the provided code:
- <a-box> — Represents a box-type object in the scene. It serves to create objects with properties such as position,
size (width, height, depth) and colour.
- <a-cylinder> — Represents a cylinder shape object in the scene. Used for creating objects with properties including
position, radius, height and colour.
- <a-sphere> — Represents a sphere object in the scene. Used to create objects with properties like position,
radius and colour.

These elements provide a convenient way to create and manipulate 3D objects in the virtual scene and are part of the
AFrame framework. To achieve the desired appearance and behaviour, they can be further customised with
various attributes and properties.

4. In this code how is user interaction enabled in the scene?

The following elements are used to activate it in the scene:
- <a-entity camera look-controls> — This element represents the camera in the scene and allows the user to control
the point of view of the camera. The viewpoint attribute allows the user to look around by moving their head or device.
- <a-cursor></a-cursor> — This element represents the cursor which is used to interact and select within the scene.
The cursor is used to provide a visual indication of where the user is pointing. It interacts by default with clickable
or interactive objects.

Here is the relevant code:
```html
<a-entity camera look-controls>
  <a-cursor></a-cursor>
</a-entity>
```
They combine to allow the user to interact with the scenery. Cursor allows users to move camera position and interact
with objects. Depending on the requirements of the application, the specific behaviour of user interaction and object
selection can be further customised and extended.

5. What is the purpose of the training simulation elements in the code?

Creating a specific scenario or environment for training purposes is the purpose of the training simulation elements in
the code. Within the architectural visualisation scene, these elements are intended to simulate a training mode.
They serve as an example of how to integrate training simulations into an architectural visualisation using
the AFrame framework. Let's have a breakdown of the training simulation elements in the code:

- <a-text position="-4 2 -5" rotation="0 30 0" value="Training Mode" color="#FFF" scale="1.5 1.5 1.5"></a-text> — This
element represents a text entity displaying the label "Training Mode". It is positioned at coordinates (-4, 2, -5) and
 rotated 30 degrees along the y-axis. The colour of the text is white. It is scaled to a factor of 1.5.

- <a-box position="-4 1 -5" width="1" height="1" depth="1" color="#FF0000" static-body></a-box> — This element
represents a red box entity that serves as a visual representation of a training object or element. It is located
at coordinates (-4, 1, -5) and is 1 unit wide, 1 unit high and 1 unit deep. The box is set as a static body, i.e.
it does not have any movement or interaction with the physics simulations.

The code provides a simple example of a training simulation where the user is required to navigate around an obstacle.
The training simulation elements are designed to be easy to modify and extend, allowing users to create training
simulations that suit their specific requirements.

It's important to note that while the provided code serves as a basic example, the training simulations can be further enhanced and customised to suit the user's specific needs.
