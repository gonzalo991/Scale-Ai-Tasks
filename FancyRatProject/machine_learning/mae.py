'''
F1-score is inherently inappropriate for regression-type predictions and is used for binary or multi-class classification 
problems.

A more compatible metric might be RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error) within the Surprise library 
for the KNN algorithm.

In any case, you’d need to change your approach and possibly use a different library that supports classification 
algorithms if you’re interested in classification-based recommendations (e.g. recommending a product or not). It has 
an array of classification algorithms and supports the F1 score metric.

'''
Using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm and the MovieLens 100k dataset, this code provides a 
complete walkthrough for building a movie recommendation system. The MovieLens dataset, which contains user 
ratings for a variety of movies, is downloaded, loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and then formatted into a form 
suitable for use with Surprise, a Python library for building recommendation systems. For model training and evaluation, 
the data is then split into training and test sets.

The code instantiates and trains the SVD model using the training set after preparing the data. To demonstrate the use 
of the model, once it has been trained, it makes a prediction of the score for a given user-item pair. Finally, the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), a common metric for regression tasks, is calculated to evaluate the model on the test data set.
The MAE measures the average size of the errors made by the model in predicting what it predicts, without considering
their direction, with lower values indicating better performance.
'''


# 3. can you give me an explanation of the code ?


'''
Here is an explanation of the code:

1.  Data download — The code starts with a download of the MovieLens 100k dataset, which is a common dataset for 
building and testing recommendation systems. The dataset contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 films.
2.  Loading the data — Load a Pandas DataFrame with the downloaded dataset. The data contains ‘user_id’, ‘item_id’ 
(representing the film), ‘rating’ and ‘timestamp’.
3.  Preparation of the data — The Surprise library requires the data to be in a specific format, which is handled by 
the Reader class. The data is then loaded from the DataFrame into the Dataset object of the Surprise library.
4.  Split the train-test — The data set is split into a training set (75 % of the data) and a test set (25 % of the 
data).
5.  Building a model — The prediction algorithm selected is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). For recommendation 
systems, SVD is a popular method. The training data set is used to train the model.
6.  Predicting — The rating that user 196 would give to item 302 is predicted using the trained model.
7.  Analysis of the results — The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated after testing the model on the test dataset. 
The MAE measures how close the model is predicting actual scores. Better model performance is indicated by lower MAE values.

To summarise, the code demonstrates how to build, train and evaluate a movie recommender using the SVD algorithm and the
 MovieLens dataset. The MAE of the predicted and actual movie ratings on the test dataset is used to evaluate the 
 effectiveness of the model.
'''


# 4. What steps would you take to improve the performance of this code if the MAE was too high?



'''
Here are some potential steps that could be taken to improve the performance of the code if the MAE was too high:

1.  Check the data for errors. An error in the data could lead to an error in the model.
2.  Make sure you have enough data to train the model. If you do not have enough data, try collecting more data. If 
the available dataset is small, gathering more data can help to improve the model’s performance.
3.  Use a different algorithm. If the MAE is still high, try using a different algorithm that is better suited for 
the problem. The Surprise library supports several other algorithms like KNN, NMF, Co-clustering, etc.
4.  Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the algorithm. The hyperparameters of an algorithm are the settings that are 
used to control how the algorithm works. The SVD algorithm has several hyperparameters that can be tuned. These include 
the number of factors, epochs, learning rate and regularisation term. To find the optimal values for these hyperparameters,
you can use methods such as grid search or random search. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithm can help to 
improve its performance.
5.  Use a different dataset. If the MAE is still high, try using a different dataset that is more suitable for 
the algorithm. If the dataset has more information like user demographics or movie attributes, these could be incorporated 
into the model to potentially improve its performance. However, the standard SVD algorithm in Surprise does not support 
this, so you would have to use a different algorithm or library that supports hybrid recommendation systems.

These steps can help to improve the performance of the code if the MAE is too high.

# 5. Could you modify the code to recommend the top-N items for a user?

'''
Here's an example of how you can modify the code to recommend the top-N items for a user:
'''

import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict
from surprise import Reader, Dataset, SVD
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split

# Download MovieLens data
!wget "http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip"
!unzip ml-100k.zip

# Load the data
header = ['user_id', 'item_id', 'rating', 'timestamp']
df = pd.read_csv('ml-100k/u.data', sep='\t', names=header)

# Define the format
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))

# Load the data from the file using the reader format
data = Dataset.load_from_df(df[['user_id', 'item_id', 'rating']], reader=reader)

# Split the dataset
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=.25)

# Use the SVD algorithm.
algo = SVD()

# Train the algorithm on the trainset
algo.fit(trainset)

# We'll pick the top 5 recommendations
N = 5

# First map the predictions to each user.
top_n = defaultdict(list)
for uid, iid, true_r, est, _ in algo.test(testset):
    top_n[uid].append((iid, est))

# Then sort the predictions for each user and retrieve the N highest ones.
for uid, user_ratings in top_n.items():
    user_ratings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    top_n[uid] = user_ratings[:N]

# Print top recommendations for each user
for uid, user_ratings in top_n.items():
    print(uid, [iid for (iid, _) in user_ratings])

'''
The code is modified to calculate the top-N items based on the mean average precision (MAP) metric. The MAP 
metric measures the average precision of the recommendations for a given user. The code then prints the top-N 
items for a user with a given UID and IID.
