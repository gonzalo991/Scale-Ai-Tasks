# 2. explain this code and how it works

'''
Here's a code explanation: 
1. Importing libraries — Imports necessary libraries, including 
nltk for natural language processing, TfidfVectorizer for TF-IDF vectorisation, cosine_similarity 
for cosine similarity, and other nltk modules for tokenisation and stemming. 

2. Class definition — To encapsulate the information retrieval functionality, the InformationRetrievalSystem 
class is defined. 3. Class initialisation — The initialisation of the class is with a list of documents as argument.
The TF-IDF vectoriser and the TF-IDF vectors are initialised as None for the time being. 

4. Training the system — Training the information retrieval system is done by the train method. It pre-processes 
the documents, calculates the TF-IDF vectors with the help of the TfidfVectorizer and assigns the vectors to 
the self.tfidf_vectors. 

5. Retrieve documents — The retrieve_documents method takes as arguments a query, optional feedback documents, 
and the number of results to be retrieved. It pre-processes the query and includes the feedback documents, if 
any are provided. It then computes the TF-IDF vector for the query, computes the cosine similarity between the 
query vector and the document vectors, selects the top indices based on the similarity, and retrieves the corresponding 
documents. It also handles cases where the number of available documents is less than the number of query results. 

6. Text preprocessing — The preprocess_text method takes an input of text and performs a number of preprocessing steps. 
It tokenises the text into words, removes stop words, performs a stemming operation using the Porter stemmer, and 
returns the preprocessed text. 

7. Example usage — An example of how to use the code is given at the bottom of this document. It involves the 
creation of an instance of the InformationRetrievalSystem class, the training of the system with a list of documents, 
the provision of a query and relevant documents (if any), and the retrieval of the top documents based on relevance. 
The code ranks documents based on their similarity to the query using TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity. 

By combining the pre-processed relevant documents with the query, it incorporates relevance feedback. The code 
also handles potential issues such as NLTK resource availability and cases where the number of available documents 
is less than requested results.



3. What is the purpose of the InformationRetrievalSystem class in the code?




The purpose of the InformationRetrievalSystem class in the code is the encapsulation of the functionality and 
components of an information retrieval system. It provides methods for training the system, retrieving documents 
based on a query, and pre-processing text data. It promotes a modular and organised code structure by defining the 
information retrieval functionality within a class. The class allows an Information Retrieval System object to be 
easily instantiated, allowing multiple instances to be created and used independent of each other. The class also 
makes the system easier to manage and maintain by encapsulating the necessary components, such as the TF-IDF vectoriser 
and TF-IDF vectors. All in all, the class serves as a container for the methods associated with information retrieval, 
allowing the code to be reused, modularised and abstracted.



4. How is the information retrieval system trained in this code?




The information retrieval system is trained using the train method. The train method pre-processes the documents, 
calculates the TF-IDF vectors with the help of the TfidfVectorizer and assigns the vectors to the self.tfidf_vectors. 
The TfidfVectorizer is a scikit-learn Text Feature Extraction module that calculates the TF-IDF vector for the documents. 
The TF-IDF vector is a representation of the document in a numerical format. The TfidfVectorizer takes into account the
number of times a word appears in a document (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the word, which is the number 
of documents in which the word appears. The training process involves calculating the TF-IDF vectors for all the documents
in the system and assigning them to the self.tfidf_vectors attribute of the InformationRetrievalSystem object. 
The tfidf_vectors attribute is then used in the retrieve_documents method to calculate the cosine similarity between 
the query vector and the document vectors. 

Here's how the training process works: 
1. On an instance of the InformationRetrievalSystem class, the train method is called. 

2. Within the train method, the preprocess_text method is used to pre-process each of the documents in 
the list of documents that is provided. 

3. The sklearn.feature_extraction.text module then passes the preprocessed documents to the TfidfVectorizer. 

4. The TF-IDF vectors for the pre-processed documents are calculated by the TfidfVectorizer. TFIDF is a numeric 
representation of the importance of each word in a document relative to a collection of documents. 

5. The calculated TF-IDF vectors are assigned to the InformationRetrievalSystem instance's self.tfidf_vectors
attribute. These vectors are later used to measure the similarity between a query and the documents. Training 
allows the system to learn the characteristics of the documents and provides a basis for comparing when retrieving.



5. Can you explain the process of text preprocessing performed in the preprocess_text method of this code?



The preprocess_text method performs a number of preprocessing steps on the text data. These steps 
help to prepare the text data for further processing and analysis. The method first tokenises the 
text into words, using the nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize function. The function then removes stopwords,
using the stopwords.words function. The list of stopwords includes common words that do not add much meaning 
to a sentence, such as "the" and "be". Next, the PorterStemmer is used to stem the tokens, which reduces the 
number of different word forms to a common base. This is done using the nltk.stem.PorterStemmer.stem 
function. Finally, the preprocessed text is returned as a single string, with the tokens separated by spaces. 

These preprocessing steps help to reduce the dimensionality of the text data and improve the accuracy of the 
information retrieval system. Here's how this gets done: 

- **Tokenisation** — The word_tokenize function from the nltk.tokenize module is used to tokenize the input text into 
individual words. Tokenisation splits text into meaningful units like words or punctuation. 

- **Lowercase** — The lower method is used to convert the tokens to lowercase. You can also change the case 
of a word by changing the case of the word itself. 

- **Remove stop words** — Stopwords are common words that have no significant meaning in a given context, 
such as 'and', 'the' or 'is'. The code retrieves a set of English stop words using the stopwords corpus from 
the nltk.corpus module. The tokens are filtered, removing all stopwords from the token list. It cuts out 
the noise and concentrates on more meaningful words. 

- **Stemming** — Stemming is the process of removing suffixes and prefixes to reduce words to their base or 
root form. The code uses the Porter stemmer algorithm from the nltk.stem module to perform the stemming operation. 
The stemmer's stemming method is applied to each token. For example, the stemmer would change 'running' to 
'run' and 'cats' to 'cat'. This step helps to merge words with similar meanings. 

- **Reconstruct the preprocessed text** — Finally, the preprocessed tokens are reassembled with a space as 
a delimiter to form the preprocessed text string. This string represents the cleaned and transformed form of the 
inputtext, ready to be processed and analysed. Through the application of these text preprocessing steps,
the preprocess_text method prepares the input text for tasks such as information retrieval by removing unnecessary 
noise, standardising the text and reducing the words to their basic forms
